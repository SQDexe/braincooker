# Braincooker

### A Brainf*ck interpreter, and compiler (WIP) written in Rust

A project dedicated to messing with some more low-level parts of a language design.  
Mostly a passion project, though it'll be lovely if some find it useful.

The interpreter allows for different cell, and pointer (tape) sizes.

For more flexibility, the interpreter allows passing values as raw numerals, and character literals.
